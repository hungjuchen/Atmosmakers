## About the inductive household nightlight:
--
Inside of the inductive household nightlight, there is a light sensor connected to the BBC micro:bit, and it will measure the surrounding amount of light. After the surrounding light input in the light sensor, the BBC micro:bit will automatically be triggered to output the light from its LEDs by Python 3. When the light sensor detects a darker environment, the BBC micro:bit will output a higher light level, and vice versa.
